## Syllabus
### Module 1: Finding and getting data
In this module you will learn how to:

* Find usable data online
* Assess sources of data
* Understand different data file formats
* Download the data

**Discussion Q1** :
*Find data about a topic you’re interested in. Send a brief message to the forums explaining what the data is about, why it matters, and how you obtained it. If possible, suggest what stories or visualizations you envision as doable based on the data. Once you’ve sent your own message to the forums, read messages from other students. Reply to at least TWO of them offering constructive comments, feedback, or even suggestions*

**Discussion Q2** :
*Find two sites that are different from those featured in Marco’s importHTML & Web Scraper video classes. The first site must contain an HTML table. You will import the table using importHTML in Google Sheets. Share the file so that anyone can view (not edit) and place the link in the forum, along with the importHTML you used. Also share the link to the site where the table is. The second site must contain information that you want to scrape to turn into a table. Use Web Scraper to scrape the information. Save the CSV file to Google Drive and share the link to the file here in the forum. Explain how you set up the scraping routine and share the link to the site as well*


### Module 2: Preparing data
In this module you will learn to: 

* Process and clean data
* Get the data ready to be analyzed and visualized
* Develop good practices in data processing

**Discussion Q1** :
*Clean up a data set of your choice based on what you’ve learned this week. It could be a data set about a topic you like, or a data set mentioned in the video lectures. Send a short post to the discussion forums explaining very briefly what you did and what problems you found. Once you’ve sent your own message to the forums, read messages from other students. Reply to at least TWO of them offering constructive comments, feedback, or even suggestions*

**Discussion Q2** :
*What are the differences between tables that were made for humans and tables that were made for computers? What are the situations where one might be better than the other? Explain in your words what makes a table "clean" and evaluate a colleague's response*


### Module 3: Finding stories in data
In this module you will learn to: 

* Identify potential insights in data sets
* Use free tools to conduct basic exploratory analysis

**Discussion Q1** :
*Explore the winning dashboards from the Visualize 2030 contest: [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/visualize-2030-meet-the-winners](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/visualize-2030-meet-the-winners). Identify the visualization that you think tells the most compelling story. List 3 reasons why you find that visualization interesting and 1 improvement that you would make*

**Discussion Q2** :
*Data Studio comes with a selection of native chart types. Identify a chart type that is not available in Data Studio. Make a post in the forum naming the chart type, link to at least one example visualization that uses that chart type, and explain specific use-cases where this chart type will be useful*

**Discussion Q3** :
*Identify an infographic or visualization from the MakeoverMonday Series ([https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/)). The underlying data for each of the viz is available at the site. Try to replicate the one visualization or at least a part of it in Data Studio while making your own improvements. Share your finished Data Studio dashboard link and comment on what improvements you made and why*


### Module 4: Machine learning in data journalism
In this module you will learn to: 

* Identify what machine learning is and isn’t
* See applications of machine learning in newsrooms
* Use these tools for investigative journalism

**Discussion Q1** :
*How might you use Machine Learning to report a story? List 2-3 examples*

**Discussion Q2** :
*Machine Learning models are sometimes described as “black boxes.” We can’t always tell why they make the decisions they do. Is this a problem for data journalism? Can we work around it?*


### Module 5: Visualizing data

### Module 6: Data-driven storytelling
